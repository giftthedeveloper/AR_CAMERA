# AR_CAMERA
A simple Camera with filters similar to Snapchat filters with Python, Open Cv and Tensorflow
This Project was created with the aid of Media Pipe official documentation.

To set up this project you need to gather filter images (png) you'd like to use
Secondly annotate them. Annotation simply means getting the landmark points of an image.
You can annotate these filter images easily with makesense ai. You can check it out on google
Makesense ai helps you get the landmarks and inserts them alongside their labels in a csv file 
making it like a dataset that Python can easily read.
